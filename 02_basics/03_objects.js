//In JavaScript, both arrays and objects are used to store collections of data,
// but they differ primarily in how data is organized, indexed, and optimized. 
// Arrays are ideal for ordered, list-like data with numeric indexing,
//  while objects are better suited for storing related data using named key-value pairs. type or structure	Used for grouping related data using labels (properties)

///*************OBJECT************ */

//Note:

//You should declare objects with the "const keyword".
// When an object is declared with const, you cannot later reassign it to point to a different variable.
// It does not make the object unchangeable. You can still modify its properties and values.
